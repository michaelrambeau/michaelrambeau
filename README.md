#### Hello, I'm Michael!

I'm the creator of [Best of JS](https://bestofjs.org/), a web application that gathers the best of JavaScript and friends: TypeScript, CSS, HTML, Node.js...

I created the project in 2015 because I'm a huge fan of the JavaScript eco-system and the web platform.

However the landscape changes so fast that it's hard to keep track of all the trends.

_Best of JS_ gathers more than 1500 projects, carefully classified under tags that make sense. It provides insights about trends on GitHub, download numbers, dependencies... the goal is to provide a valuable tool to all developers.

It can be used as a super fast search engine when you need to look-up quickly a project on GitHub.

To support the project, you can become a [GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/michaelrambeau) or [star the project on GitHub](https://github.com/bestofjs/bestofjs-webui).

Thank you for your support!
